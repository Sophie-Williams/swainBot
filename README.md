## Introduction
### What is League of Legends?
League of Legends (abbreviated as LoL, or League) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games which features two teams of five players each competing in head-to-head matches with the ultimate goal of destroying the opposing teams nexus structure. The game boasts millions of monthly players and a large competitive scene involving dozens of teams participating in both national and international tournaments. The game takes place across two broadly defined phases. In the first phase (or Drafting phase), each side takes turns assembling their team by selecting a unique character (called a champion) from a pool of almost 140 (as of this writing) without replacement. Then, in the second phase (or Play phase), each player in the match takes control of one of the champions chosen by their team and attempts to claim victory. Although not strictly required by the game, over the years players usually elect to play their champion in one of five roles named after the location on the map in which they typically start the game, and often corresponding to the amount of resources that player will have devoted to them:

- Position 1 (primary farm)-> ADC/Marksman<sup>1</sup>
- Position 2 (secondary farm)-> Middle
- Position 3 (tertiary farm)-> Top
- Position 4 (farming support)-> Jungle
- Position 5 (primary support)-> Support<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Typically the ADC and Support begin the game together same lane and are collectively called 'Bottom'.

Each champion has distinct set of characteristics and abilities that allows them excel in certain situations and struggle in others. As a of result, it is important that the team assembled during the drafting phase simultaneously plays into one cohesive set of strengths and disrupts or plays well against the strengths of the opposing draft in order to maximize the odds of victory. The structure of the drafting phase is displayed in Figure 1.
